excellent service. The real standout, though, was breakfast. The scrambled eggs had a perfect consistency with just the right balance of creaminess, the hollandaise sauce was surprisingly airy with well-balanced acidity, and the bread pudding was incredibly rich in both flavor and texture. Not everything was exceptional, and the selection could be broader, but those three dishes made a lasting impression.
